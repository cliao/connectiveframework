<h1> ABOUT </h1><p><br>The world around us is comprised of an infinite number of connections. The connections we personally make create a unique framework in which we deposit new information and experiences that defines us as individuals and allows us to grow. My thesis is a body of work that comprehensively explores different aspects of this connective framework.
<br><br>
Making connections is the basis of learning. We are initially taught to relate things within content. Then we move forward to make connections that relate to ourselves, and finally we learn to relate them to our surroundings. The latter two are the more advanced and meaningful connections, but are also easily overlooked when hidden under the obvious disparities.  Despite the fact that this process has been ingrained into our minds at such an early stage of our lives, as we age the quality of the connections we make weakens along with our curiosity. We become so blind to these more meaningful types of connections that when they do unveil themselves, they often take us by surprise and leave giddy expressions on our faces. 
<br><br>
Ironically, the advent of technology and global connectivity does not help reactivate this skill. Technology pioneered by companies such as Google have begun the creation of a global consciousness accessible to everyone. Now algorithms and analytics make connections for us, and eliminates the need for humans to make basic connections. It is no longer necessary to make small talk when meeting a new person to see who you know in common, because a simple internet search will tell you who your mutual friends are more efficiently and thoroughly. 
<br><br>
However technology by itself can only go so far. The human mind needs to be added back into the equation in order to create extraordinary connections. We must take the generic foundational knowledge and connections that these search engines and analytics  have generated and add in the dynamism of the human condition to create more meaningful and awe-inspiring connections. 
<br><br>
By analyzing how connections are made and seeing them in different visual forms, my intention is to remind people of the many intricate ways that connections can be made. Often times, they can lead us down seemingly random paths,  but with each turn, our knowledge base expands and molds our unique framework that grows as we do.
<br><br>
My work uses formal and conceptual experimentation to analyze different types of connections. Connections can be made through the people we meet or the things we encounter. They can be comprised  of the personal associations we have with memories or the conceptual connections we create. Each component of my thesis falls on a specific point in the connective framework, a graphic plotting system I developed to analyze the types of connections we make.  Personal versus conceptual connections lie on one axis, and generated versus existing content lies on the other. 
<br><br>
This framework informed my process of generating projects. As I plotted completed projects into the system, I aimed to create new projects in areas I have not yet explored, using previous projects as springboards for content and ideas. As a result, all the projects interconnect in numerous ways. I was then able to create variations on this framework, using different criteria of comparison for the two axes, creating a series of complementary frameworks. 
<br><br>
With so much at our fingertips, we should be making connections at an exponential rate rather than allow technology to bear the brunt of our creation. We must use these tools to build upon and strengthen our own connections;  the more meaningful, personal, and awe-inspiring ones that technology strives to make, but lacks the humanity to do so.<br><br><br>
